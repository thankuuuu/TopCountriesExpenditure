Welcome to visualization the educational, health, and military expenditure of the top 15 countries from 2010-2015 project. In the project includes the html files of the visualization and analysis part. Google API chartGoogle API, JavaScript, and HTML are used to make all visualization part in this project. Data especially on education part have a lot of missing values. So for better visualization purpose, I decided to choose the countries and year regarding to this issues and also excluded some big countries due to their extreme expenditures over other small countries.

## Purpose
The purpose of ths website is to visualize the data of top countries on their military, health, and education expenditures in more easily understood formatand and try to analyze the pattern and trend of these three kinds of spending.

## Data Source
The military dataset and GDP was obtained from the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database. Health and education data were retreived from the World Bank Open Database.

## Preparng and Cleaning Data Process
Data preparing and cleaning was done using Python.

## Conclusion

- France stick on highest absolute military spending, but Iran is the most in term of %GDP spending. For Health and Education absolute spending, Germany stay on the top absolute spending among these countries. The interesting is that New Zealand, Sweden and Norway percent shared GDP on education are more than the larger country Germany and France.
- Almost all countries except Indonesia spending on health more than 50% among these three types spending. 
- Iran has the most portion of military which is about 21% among these three type of spending while other countries are only around 5%-10%.
- Norway has the most average GDP per Capita follow by Sweden. On the other hand, Indonesia has the lowest GDP per Capita among this group.
- There is a positive relationship btw spending and GDP, countries with more GDP per Capita trend to spend more money on Health and Education. 
- In term of spending per Capita, France and Germany are not extreme as it first seen as there have more population size therefore more total spending.
- The more growing in spending reflect that the GDP of this country is growing since the percent shared GDP are nearly the same especially in military.
- In conclusion, most country are the same in the way their give priority to Heath care more than Education and Military which focus the most on their population health. And they also encountered the same GDP problem in 2015.
